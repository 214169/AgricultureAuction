    <p>Government now trying to be digitalised in every field. Agriculture is backbone of India, here many farmers doing good production of crop but they are not able to sell their product
        at good price. At the end they tired and quit farming and move on to other business and services.
    </p>
    <p>
With the help of this project we tried to make a platform for all the farmers to list their product online on their price. We will help them to list the product on our auction, where merchants
        from different states see the products and purchase at best price. It will help merchants also to purchase product from different states at reasonable rates.
    </p>
    <p>Merchants will bid on the products as per their choice. As many merchants will bid on same product, there will be enough chances for Farmer to sell his product to higher Bidder. It will 
        help farmers to sell their product at good price. <b> Our Project will help Farmers to sell their crops online at best price.</b>
